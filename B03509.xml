            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>And many Thou≈øands dayly do re≈øort,</l>
            <l>There to behold the Pa≈øtime and the Sport</l>
            <l>Early and late, u≈øed by young and old,</l>
            <l>And valu'd not the fiercene≈øs of the Cold;</l>
            <l>And did not think of that Almighty Hand</l>
            <l>Who made the Waters bare, like to the Land:</l>
            <l>Thou≈øands and Thou≈øands to the River flocks,</l>
            <l>Where mighty flakes of Ice do lye like Rocks.</l>
            <l>There may you ≈øee the <hi>Coaches</hi> ≈øwiftly run,</l>
            <l>As if beneath the Ice were Waters none;</l>
            <l>And ≈øholes of People every where there be,</l>
            <l>Ju≈øt like to Herrings in the bracki≈øh Sea;</l>

            <l>But to be ≈øhort, ≈øuch Wonders there are ≈øeen,</l>
            <l>That in this Age before hath never been.</l>
            <l>Before the <hi>Temple</hi> there a Street is made,</l>
            <l>And there is one almo≈øt of every Trade:</l>
            <l>There may you al≈øo this hard Fro≈øty Winter,</l>
            <l>See on the Rocky Ice a Working-<hi>PRINTER,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who hopes by his own Art to reap ≈øome gain,</l>
            <l>Which he perchance does think he may obtain.</l>
            <l>Here is al≈øo a Lottery and Mu≈øick too,</l>
            <l>Yea, a cheating, drunken, leud, and <hi>debauch'd crew.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Hot Codlins, Pancakes, Duck, Goo≈øe, and Sack,</l>
            <l>Rabit, Capon, Hen, Turkey, and a wooden Jack.</l>
            <l>In this ≈øame Street before the <hi>Temple</hi> made,</l>
            <l>There ≈øeems to be a brisk and lively Trade:</l>
            <l>Where e'ry Booth hath ≈øuch a cunning Sign,</l>
            <l>As ≈øeldome hath been ≈øeen in former time;</l>
            <l>The <hi>Flying Pi≈øs-pot</hi> is one of the ≈øame,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Whip</hi> and <hi>Egg-≈øhell,</hi> and the <hi>Broom</hi> by name:</l>
            <l>And there if you have Money for to ≈øpend,</l>
            <l>Each cunning Snap will ≈øeem to be your Friend.</l>
            <l>There may you ≈øee ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels under Sail,</l>
            <l>All's one to them, with or again≈øt the Gale,</l>
            <l>And as they pa≈øs they little Guns do fire,</l>
            <l>Which feedeth ≈øome, and puffs them with de≈øire</l>
            <l>To ≈øail therein, and when their Money's gone,</l>
            <l>'Tis right, they cry, the <hi>Thames</hi> to come upon.</l>
            <l>There on a Sign you may mo≈øt plainly ≈øee't,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Here's the fir≈øt Tavern built in</hi> Freezeland-≈øtreet:</l>
            <l>There is Bull-baiting and Bear-baiting too,</l>
            <l>That no Man living yet e're found ≈øo true;</l>
            <l>And Foot-Ball play is there ≈øo common grown,</l>
            <l>That on the <hi>Thames</hi> before was never known;</l>
            <l>Coals being dear, are carry'd on Mens backs,</l>
            <l>And ≈øome on Sledges there are drawn in Sacks;</l>
            <l>Men do on Hor≈øe-back ride from ≈øhore to ≈øhore,</l>
            <l>Which formerly in Boats were wafted o're:</l>
            <l>Poor people hard ≈øhifts make for livelihoods,</l>
            <l>And happy are if they can ≈øell their Goods;</l>
            <l>What you can buy for Three-pence on the ≈øhore,</l>
            <l>Will co≈øt you Four-pence on the <hi>Thames,</hi> or more.</l>
            <l>Now let me come to things more ≈øtrange, yet true,</l>
            <l>And que≈øtion not what I declare to you;</l>
            <l>There Roa≈øted was a great and well-fed Oxe,</l>
            <l>And there, with Dogs, Hunted the cunning Fox;</l>
            <l>Dancing o'th' Ropes, and Puppit-<hi>plays</hi> likewi≈øe,</l>
            <l>The like before ue'r ≈øeen beneath the Skies;</l>
            <l>All ≈øtand admir'd, and very well they may,</l>
            <l>To ≈øee ≈øuch pa≈øtimes, and ≈øuch ≈øorts of play.</l>
            <l>Be≈øides the things I nam'd to you before,</l>
            <l>There other Toys and Baubles are great ≈øtore;</l>
            <l>There may you fea≈øt your wandring eyes enough,</l>
            <l>There you may buy a Box to hold your Snuff:</l>
            <l>No Fair nor Market underneath the Skies</l>
            <l>That can afford you more Varieties;</l>
            <l>There may you ≈øee ≈øome hundreds ≈ølide in Skeets,</l>
            <l>And beaten paths like to the City Streets.</l>
            <l>There were <hi>Dutch</hi> Whim≈øies turned ≈øwiftly round,</l>
            <l>Fa≈øter then Hor≈øes run on level Ground:</l>
            <l>The like to this I now to you do tell,</l>
            <l>No former Age could ever parallel;</l>
            <l>There's all that can ≈øupply mo≈øt curious minds,</l>
            <l>With ≈øuch Varieties of cunning Signs,</l>
            <l>That I do think no Man doth under≈øtand,</l>
            <l>Such merry Fancies ne'r were on the Land;</l>
            <l>There is ≈øuch Whim≈øies on the Frozen Ice,</l>
            <l>Makes ≈øome believe the <hi>Thames</hi> a Paradice.</l>
            <l>And though the≈øe ≈øights be to our admiration,</l>
            <l>Yet our ≈øins, our ≈øins, do call for lamentation.</l>
            <l>Though ≈øuch unu≈øual Fro≈øts to us are ≈øtrange,</l>
            <l>Perhaps it may predict ≈øome greater Change;</l>
            <l>And ≈øome do fear may a fore-runner be</l>
            <l>Of an approaching ≈øad Mortality:</l>
            <l>But why ≈øhould we to ≈øuch belief incline?</l>
            <l>There's none that knows but the ble≈øt pow'r <hi>divine</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And what≈øoe're is from <hi>Jehovah</hi> fent,</l>
            <l>Poor Sinners ought therewith to be content;</l>
            <l>If dreadful, then to fall upon the knee,</l>
            <l>And beg remi≈ø≈øion of the DEITY:</l>
            <l>But if beyond our thoughts he ≈øends us ≈øtore,</l>
            <l>With all our hearts let's thankful be therefore.</l>
            <l>Now let us all in Great <hi>Jehovah</hi> tru≈øt,</l>
            <l>Who doth pre≈øerve the Righteous and the Ju≈øt;</l>
            <l>And eke conclude Sin is the cau≈øe of all</l>
            <l>The heavy Judgements that on us do fall:</l>
            <l>And call to mind; fond Man, thy time mi≈øpent,</l>
            <l>Fall on thy knees, and heartily Repent,</l>
            <l>Then will thy Saviour pitty take on thee,</l>
            <l>And thou ≈øhalt live to all Eternity.</l>
